# ntuautn: IEEE COVID-19 Public Health Informatics Challenge

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth many challenges to the scientific community, from testing, diagnosing and contact tracing, to prevention, treatment and identification of risk factors. Over the past decade there have been significant technological advancements, especially in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, which motivates researchers to find novel solutions to the aformentioned challenges by making use of these technologies. In this context, the IEEE COVID-19 Sensor Informatics Challenge poses the question of whether audio data can be utilized for diagnosing the disease, without sacrificing interpretability. In this work we propose a partially interpretable pipeline based on convolutional neural networks for determining if a subject is likely to have COVID, based on audio samples of their breathing, speech and cough, which were provided in the context of the challenge.
